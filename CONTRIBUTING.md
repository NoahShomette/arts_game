## Benevolant Dictator

While the game is community developed, open source, and free, the game needs guidance, direction, and decision making otherwise it will collapse and never succeed. Noah Shomette fulfills that role acting as the Benevolant Dictator.

Noah Shomette is the main developer but community contributions are sorely needed and incredibly welcome! If the contribution is an improvement and aligned with overarching goals it will be merged in. However Noah maintains veto power over creative and technical decisions with the goal of creating a cohesive and effect whole.
