**A**ctual **R**eal **T**ime **S**trategy Game.

ARTS is an RTS game that takes place in actual real time, across days, weeks, and maybe months. It is Open Source, community developed and maintained, and free.

It takes massive inspiration from [Subterfuge](http://subterfuge-game.com/) as well as the [Bytro](https://bytro.com/games/) set of games as the direct ancestors of the Actual Real Time Games. Additionally lots of inspiration is taken from the vast amount of RTS games like Hearts of Iron, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, and more.

## Game Description

ARTS Game has the goal of being an Actual Real Time Game in the vein of Subterfuge while incorporating more of the gamey gameplay elements from the Bytro games, traditional RTS', or other more traditional games.

### Platform Support

Any platform marked with an x and labeled `Supported` have official clients that are supported and actively developed.

Platforms marked as `Planned` are not currently supported but we plan/are working on support for them.

Mobile and Web platforms are high on the list to get working early in the games development as they are both incredibly useful and core to players being able to actually play the game. However development is just easier if it only really needs to care about desktop for a bit.

Any other platform is not supported.
