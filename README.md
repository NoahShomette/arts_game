**A**ctual **R**eal **T**ime **S**trategy Game. 

ARTS is an RTS game that takes place in actual real time, across days, weeks, and maybe months. It is Open Source, community developed and maintained, and free.

It takes massive inspiration from [Subterfuge](http://subterfuge-game.com/) as well as the [Bytro](https://bytro.com/games/) set of games as the direct ancestors of the Actual Real Time Games. Additionally lots of inspiration is taken from the vast amount of RTS games like Hearts of Iron, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, and more.

## Game Description
ARTS Game has the goal of being an Actual Real Time Game in the vein of Subterfuge while incorporating more of the gamey gameplay elements from the Bytro games, traditional RTS', or other more traditional games.
