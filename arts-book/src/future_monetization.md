# Future Monetization

In the future, if the game becomes succesfull, it might become neccesary to investigate monetizing parts of the game, builds, access, etc to enable continued support and development.

This document is an advanced and _brief_ investigation showing and explaining the general ideas and goals that would guide that. This document should absolutely not be taken as a sign that any of this is set in stone, including monetization at all. Monetization would only be implemented if it was needed to support and develop the game at the level that the games success requires it to. At such a time this would be an open discussion with the community. Until that time arrives and that discussion is had, the game will remain 100% free to play and donation supported.

## Free and Open Source

First and foremost, no matter how the game is monetized, the game _must_ remain available in the github repo for free under MIT/Apache licenses. Any monetization strategy must take this into account.

Possible options for monetization include:

- Charge for Binaries. (Similar to Mindustry)
- Charge for accounts that enable extra functionality in game that is not exclusive or neccesary to play (See Subterfuge L2 accounts and Bytro games premium accounts)
  - **IDEAS**
  - Premium accounts are only ones allowed to make games
  - Premium accounts have finer detail controls over armies postures and stances

Monetization **Must Not** include features such as paying to speed up game actions, paying to gain an in game advantage, or any similar action.
